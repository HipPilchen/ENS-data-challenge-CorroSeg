# Projet "Apprentissage et Génération par Échantillonnage de Probabilités"


## Introduction

This project is part of the "Learning and Sampling Generation by Probabilistic Sampling" course taught by Stéphane Mallat at the Collège de France. I am currently enrolled in the Master of Computer Vision and Learning (MVA) program, where this project serves as a practical application of the concepts covered in the course.

## Project Description

The main objective of this project is to develop a system for segmenting defects in conduit images. Defect segmentation is a critical task in various industries, including manufacturing and infrastructure maintenance. By precisely identifying and delineating defects in images, we can facilitate timely repairs and preventive maintenance, thereby improving safety and operational efficiency.
